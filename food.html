    <div class="subsubbig2">
      <p>Here are some restaurant recommendations that I would make if you were to visit San Francisco.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="subbig2">
    <p>I am excited to list out some of the best restaurants in SF.
    <br>San Francisco is bay area, it should not be a surprise that San Francisco has some of the best clam chowder in the world. </p> 
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bigsection2">
  <div class="picgallery ro1">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant9.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Dimsum and some Chinese cuisine"/>
    <p>In San Francisco, there is one of the biggest Chinatown across the states, you can try real Chinesefood like Dimsum!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro1">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant3.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Brunch frech toast at Mama's on Washington Square"/>
    <p>Thrid one is Mama's on Washington Square - this is a must place to enjoy a delicious breakfast. Be prepared for a long line up.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro2">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant5.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Innout burger with palm trees"/>
    <p>I would not forget to mention my favorite burger which is In-N-Out Burger. The meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese are all so fresh!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro2">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant6.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Cheeseburgers with fries at Innout burger"/>
    <p>You can order "Animal Style" fries from their not-so secret menu,which is worth trying.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro2">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant7.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Six cups of salt&straws ice creams"/>
    <p>After a big meal, Are you ready with some dessert? This is Salt&Straw's ice creams. They have every classic flavor of ice cream which is handmade from locally sourced ingredients.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro3">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant1.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Interior of Foreign Cinema restaurant in San Francisco"/>
    <p>Are you ready for a dinner? I would recommend Foreign Cinema that is a one-of-a-kind, nationally recognized restaurant that combines independent cinema with California-Mediterranean cuisine. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro3">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant4.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="One of the popular sea food dishes at Foreign Cinema"/>
    <p>Also, don't forget to try their seafood. San Francisco is bay area, so you can enjoy fresh seafood. Seafood fiends can start with fresh East or West Coast oysters, including Miyagi.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="picgallery ro3">
    <img src="images/sf_restaurant2.jpg" class="food_pic" alt="Crab Cioppino at Sotto Mare"/>
    <p>Second restaurant that can be considered for dinner is Sotto Mare which is San Franciscos' Best Italian Seafood Restaurant. Highly recommend to try Crab Cioppino.</p>
